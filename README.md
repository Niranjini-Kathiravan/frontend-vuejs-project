# 🏋️‍♂️ Nirugram – A Vue.js Fitness Tracker App

**Nirugram** is a modern fitness tracking web application built entirely using **Vue 3** and the **Composition API**. This project was developed independently by me as part of my learning journey into modern frontend frameworks, using Vue.js best practices, reusable components, and state management.

The app allows users to browse structured workouts, track their fitness goals, and interact with a clean, responsive UI.
